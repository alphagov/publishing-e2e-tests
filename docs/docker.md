# Docker

## Usage

- Run programs within containers using `docker-compose`:
  `docker-compose run publishing-e2e-tests bundle exec rspec`
- Get shell access to a given container: `docker-compose run specialist-frontend bash`
- Kill the containers and move on with your life: `docker-compose down`

## Configuration

We recommend that you configure Docker to use at least 4 CPUs with 6 GB of
memory, otherwise you may find the apps struggle to run well enough to pass the
tests.

## Adding containers

- Create a `Dockerfile` in the repository of the app you want to add.
- Edit `Makefile` to include the repository for the app.
- Define the service and its relationship to other services in
  `docker-compose.yml`

## Local apps

If you want to use a local version of an application, symlink your
directory into `./apps`. For example:

```
rm -rf apps/publishing-api
ln -s path/to/publishing-api apps/publishing-api
```

## Quirks

Docker limits the amount of disk space it uses. This sometimes results in
rather opaque errors when you try and run tasks - generally related to
errors installing Mongo or Postres. One example is
`Moped::Errors::ConnectionFailure: Could not connect to a primary node for
replica set`.

The most reliable way to fix this is to find and remove unnecessary Docker
containers and images.

```
docker rmi $(docker images -f dangling=true -q)
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q -f dangling=true)
```

Docker for Mac will start comsuming vast amounts of CPU when it isn't given
enough RAM.   If you find the apps aren't booting within the 60 second timeout
then I'd recommend increasing the memory limit by at least 1GB.
